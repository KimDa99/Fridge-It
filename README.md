# Why I Made This App

Whenever I watch or search for recipes, there are always ingredients I don't have.

Fridge-It aims to solve this problem by recommending recipes based on what users already have in their fridge. 
This app simplifies the cooking experience, minimizes the need for additional grocery shopping, and encourages users to make the most of the ingredients they already possess.
